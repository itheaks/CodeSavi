        In your usual routine <br />going to work, the cafe,<br />
        school or other places<br />
        commit to pick up at <br />least one piece of plastic, at<br />
        least once a week. Put a <br />once-off dot on the <br />map, that adds
        to the<br />
        global count. Others<br />
        will follow your lead.<br />
        Also, prefer businesses<br />
        that are trying to<br />
        reduce their impact <br />on the planet.

        If your business is <br />committed to recycling or <br />taken any
        other<br />
        steps to reduce<br />
        waste, list on <br />our new business <br />directory. Here’s some
        <br />examples (on Sustainable <br />Social). You may<br />
        consider plenty of<br />
        other waste saving <br />ideas – good<br />
        for the plant and <br />good for business.

        Two or more <br />people who get<br />
        together to pick<br />
        up plastics – let’s<br />
        call them Plastic<br />
        Patrols. And groups<br />
        of joggers who<br />
        pick up plastics,<br />
        Ploggers. Sign up <br />as a group and <br />post your activities<br />,
        so others see <br />it and together let’s <br />expand this movement.
